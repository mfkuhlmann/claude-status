# Changelog

## 0.1.1

From the widget's latest fixes (backend synced to its GNOME release):

- A shared chat that moved on to a copy of itself, after that copy was shared
  too, is listed once instead of twice.
- The last minute before a plan limit resets reads "resets in <1m", not "0m".
- New status is stored before the pets and notifications react to it, so one
  reaction that fails can't stop the view from updating (the widget froze at
  every plan-limit reset that way).
- GNOME: chats running outside VS Code are brought to the front through the
  widget's GNOME Shell extension, chats open in GNOME's terminal with
  `claudeStatus.openIn` = `system`, and sounds use GNOME's sound theme.

## 0.1.0

First version: the Claude Status Plasma widget's dashboard in VS Code.

- Every Claude Code chat on this computer and on picked SSH hosts, in an
  Activity Bar view (also as an editor tab), with plan usage, tokens,
  subagents, recent chats and the animated Clawd pets.
- Runs on your side, also in Remote-SSH windows; the window's host is shown
  without setup.
- Chats open in VS Code's terminal on the machine they're on.
- Notifications and sounds from one window at a time; status bar item and
  Activity Bar badge.
- Plan usage bars setup for any status line, with undo.
- Demo mode for screenshots.
